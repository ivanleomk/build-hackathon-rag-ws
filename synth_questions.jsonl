The lungs are a pair of spongy, air-filled organs located on either side of the chest (thorax). The trachea (windpipe) conducts inhaled air into the lungs through its tubular branches, called bronchi. The bronchi then divide into smaller and smaller branches (bronchioles), finally becoming microscopic. Between the alveoli is a thin layer of cells called the interstitium, which contains blood vessels and cells that help support the alveoli. The lungs are covered by a thin tissue layer called the pleura. The same kind of thin tissue lines the inside of the chest cavity -- also called pleura."}

{"question": "What do basalt and granite have in common?", "source": "Basalt and granite actually have quite a bit in common. Both are igneous rocks, which means that they cooled from a magma (the earth gets very hot just below the surface, and there is lots of liquid rock available). Both are made up of minerals from the silicate group, so both have large amounts of silicon and oxygen. Granite is the ultimate silicate rock. As discussed elsewhere in greater detail, on average oxygen and silicon account for 75% of the earth's crust. The remaining 25% is split among several other elements, with aluminum and potassium contributing the most to the formation of the continental granitic rocks."}

{"question": "What additional cost can be incurred if a concrete truck cannot back up to dump the mix in the intended spot?", "source": "In addition to the cubic yard cost, some delivery companies also have minimum purchase requirements. A cubic yard of concrete commonly runs between $80 and $165, and it\u2019s standard to order a quarter of a yard extra in case you run short. For example, if you need 2 cubic yards to pour the pad, order 2 1/4 yards. If the pad is in a spot where a concrete truck cannot back up and dump the mix, you can order a pump truck, which can add another $300, or more, to the cost. If forming and pouring your pad takes three workers two days to complete at a cost of $30 per worker hour, it could add around $1,400 to your bill. That\u2019s not counting concrete, reinforcement, excavation and fill sand costs."}

{"question": "What is the toxin responsible for botulism food poisoning and how is it produced?", "source": "Food poisoning. In botulism food poisoning, the toxin is produced by the vegetative cells of C botulinum in contaminated food, and preformed toxin then is ingested with the contaminated food. The incubation time can vary from a few hours to 10 days, but most commonly is 18\u201336 hours. Clinical Manifestations. Botulism is a disease caused by the toxin of a diverse group of clostridia called C botulinum. This neurotoxin characteristically causes a symmetrical, descending paralysis (Fig. 18-3). The symptoms of botulism can occur in both the nervous system and the alimentary tract of the patient."}

{"question": "What are some experts' opinions on the minimum age for children to be unsupervised at a pool or beach according to the text?", "source": "So how do parents determine if a child is \u2018old enough\u2019 to be unsupervised at a pool or beach? Broward County in Florida is on the cutting edge of water safety and they recommend a minimum age of 12, though some experts believe it should be even higher. Our YMCA has a test that kids must pass to be able to swim in the deep pool and go down the slide. It requires swimming the length of the pool in more than just a dog paddle and treading water for 30 seconds. They will not hesitate to fail a kid if they don\u2019t think they are handling even if they are doing it."}

{"question": "What are the age guidelines for children to be left alone at the Cincinnati Sports Club's Fairfax private pool?", "source": "The Enquirer found some pools allow children as young as 8 to be at the pool alone. Others used height as part of the equation. In Dayton, at city-owned pools, children 8 and younger must have a parent or guardian in the water at all times.

Farhad Madani, who owns Austin, Texas-based consulting company Aquatic Safety Experts, said there is no real appropriate age for a child to be left alone at a pool because every child is different. A person 16 and older can watch one child younger than 12 and a person 18 and older can watch up to 10 children who are younger than 12.

It is divided into two cortices, along the sagittal plane: the left and right cerebral hemispheres divided by the medial longitudinal fissure. The cerebral cortex plays a key role in memory, attention, perception, awareness, thought, language, and consciousness. The human cerebral cortex is 2 to 4 millimetres (0.079 to 0.157 in) thick. In large mammals, the cerebral cortex is folded, giving a much greater surface area in the confined volume of the skull."}

{"question": "What is the role of gametophyte in the development of sporophyte in bryophytes?", "source": "In flowering plants, the sporophyte comprises the whole multicellular body except the pollen and embryo sac. Bryophytes (mosses, liverworts and hornworts) have a dominant gametophyte phase on which the adult sporophyte is dependent for nutrition. The embryo sporophyte develops by cell division of the zygote within the female sex organ or archegonium, and in its early development is therefore nurtured by the gametophyte. In flowering plants the gametophytes are very reduced in size, and are represented by the pollen and the embryo sac. The sporophyte produces spores (hence the name) by meiosis, a process also known as reduction division that reduces the number of chromosomes in each spore mother cell by half."}

Hepatitis A. You usually get it when you eat or drink something that's got the virus in it. It's the least risky type because it almost always gets better on its own.
